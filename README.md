# Heart Disease Prediction and Risk Analysis Tool
The Heart Disease Prediction and Risk Analysis Tool is a web-based application developed using Python and Streamlit that leverages machine learning and deep learning to assess the risk of heart disease. It uses a Random Forest model for structured health data prediction and a CNN model to classify ECG waveform images. The tool also integrates Googleâ€™s Gemini API to offer personalized health advice based on user inputs. Designed with a clean and interactive interface, this project provides real-time predictions, risk levels, and actionable health recommendations.
